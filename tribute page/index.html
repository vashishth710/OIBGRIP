    <h1>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h1>
    <p class="date">(31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950)</p><br>
    <img src="https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/31-October-1875-15-December-1950.jpg" alt="Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel-Iron Man Of India" >
    <p class="intro"><b>Vallabhbhai Patel was a senior leader of the Indian National Congress 
       and a prominentfigure in the Indian Freedom Struggle, who later became 
       India’s first Deputy Prime Minister and first Home Minister.</b> </p>


    <h5>Vallabhbhai Patel’s early life</h5>
    <ul>
        <li class="shadow">Vallabhbhai Patel was born in Nadiad, Gujarat, on October 31, 1875 (His birth anniversary is now observed as National Unity Day or Rashtriya Ekta Diwas).</li>
        <li class="shadow">He hailed from a farmer’s family. In his early years, Patel was considered by many as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job.</li>
        <li class="shadow"> He passed law examination, often studying himself, with borrowed books.</li>
        <li class="shadow">Patel practised law at Godhra, Borsad, and Anand in Gujarat, after passing the bar examination.</li>
        <li class="shadow">He earned the reputation of being a fierce and skilled lawyer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Patel’s early willingness to sacrifice for others</h5>
    <ul>
        <li class="shadow">Patel had a dream to study law in England.</li>
        <li class="shadow">Using his hard-earned savings, he managed to get a pass and a ticket to go to England.</li>
        <li class="shadow">However, the ticket was addressed to ‘V.J. Patel’.</li>
        <li class="shadow"> His elder brother Vithalbhai also had the same initials as Vallabhai. Sardar Patel came to know that his elder brother too cherished a dream to go to England for studies.</li>
        <li class="shadow">In keeping with concerns for his family’s honour (disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother), Vallabhbhai Patel allowed Vithalbhai Patel to go, in his place.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s role in the Indian Freedom Movement</h5>
    <ul>
        <li class="shadow">In the initial stages of the freedom movement, Patel was neither keen on active politics nor the principles of Mahatma Gandhi. However, the meeting with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in Godhra (1917) fundamentally changed Patel’s life.</li>
        <li class="shadow">Patel joined the Congress and became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha that became a Congress stronghold later.</li>
        <li class="shadow">Patel joined Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement (1920) and travelled around West India to recruit 3,00,000 members. He also collected more than Rs 1.5 million for the party fund.</li>
        <li class="shadow">There was a British law banning the hoisting of the Indian Flag. When Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned, it was Patel who led the Satyagraha movement in Nagpur in 1923 against British law.</li>
        <li class="shadow">It was the Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928 which earned Vallabhbhai Patel the title of ‘Sardar’ and made him popular throughout the country. So great was the impact that Pandit Motilal Nehru suggested Vallabhbhai’s name to Gandhiji for the presidency of the Congress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Gandhi and Patel</h5>
    <ul>
        <li class="shadow">Patel was always loyal to Gandhi. However, he differed with Gandhiji on certain issues.</li>
        <li class="shadow">Following Gandhiji’s assassination, he said: “I claim to be nothing more than an obedient soldier of him like the millions who obeyed his call.</li>
        <li class="shadow">There was a time when everyone used to call me his blind follower. But, both he and I knew that I followed him because our convictions tallied”.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel – As Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister</h5>
    <ul>
        <li class="shadow">After Independence, he became India’s first Deputy Prime Minister. On the first anniversary of Independence, Patel was appointed as the Home Minister of India.</li>
        <li class="shadow">As the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, Patel organised relief efforts for refugees fleeing from Punjab and Delhi and worked to restore peace.</li>
        <li class="shadow">In what was to become Sardar Patel’s most lasting legacy, he took charge of the States Department and was responsible for the accession of 565 princely states into the Union of India. Paying tribute to him, Nehru called Sardar ‘the builder and consolidator of new India.’</li>
        <li class="shadow">However, the invaluable services of Sardar Patel were available to independent India for just 3 years. The brave son of India died on 15 December 1950 (aged 75), after suffering a massive heart attack.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
